<h1 style="color:#29e5ab;">What are the causes of a low resting heart rate (bradycardia)?</h1>
<div>
    <ul><li>You may <b>calculated your heart rate incorrectly</b>.</li>
        <li>You <b>may be extremely fit</b>. Fitter people often have a low resting heart rate, as the heart gets more efficient at pumping blood around the body, so at rest more blood can be pumped around with each beat, therefore less beats per minute are needed.</li>
        <li>A <b>medication you are on may have caused your heart rate to slow</b>. Some medicines that may slow the heart include those for treating heart problems or high blood pressure, such as beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics, and digoxin.</li>
        <li><b>Heart diseases</b> that damage the heart's electrical system, such as coronary artery disease, heart attack, and infections such as endocarditis and myocarditis. There are also conditions that can slow the electrical impulses through the heart, such as having a low thyroid level or an electrolyte imbalance.</li>
