<h1 style="color:#29e5ab;">Measuring Heart Rate</h1>
<div>
    <ul><li>You may not be <b>fully rested</b>. Resting heart rate is ideally taken after a few minutes upon waking while still lying in bed. </li>
<li>The measurement of resting heart rate or pulse rate (the number of heart beats per minute) should be taken after a few minutes upon waking whilst still lying in bed. </li>
        <li>Give your body some time to adjust to the change from sleeping before taking your pulse (2-5 minutes). </li>
        <li>If you are not able to take a measurement first thing in the morning, make sure you lie down for at least 10 minutes before taking a measurement. </li>
        <li>Taking a radial or carotid pulse measurement (at the wrist or neck) is usually the easiest method. </li>
        <li><b>Radial Pulse (wrist)</b> - place your index and middle fingers together on the opposite wrist, about 1/2 inch on the inside of the joint, in line with the index finger. Once you find a pulse, count the number of beats you feel within a one minute period.</li>
        <li><b>Carotid Pulse (neck)</b> - to measure your heart rate at the neck, place your first two fingers on either side of the neck until you can feel the beats. Be careful not too press to hard, then count the number of beats for a minute.</li>
    </ul></div>
